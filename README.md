Collection of statics and probability related home-made Matlab functions. The functions are categorized by topics and placed in related folders.


Highlights from the content
--------
* univariate distributions many with maximum likelihood fit: lognormal, Weibull, logPearson, etc.
* bivariate distribution functions, mostly copulas: Clayton, Gumbel, normal, HÃ¼sler-Reiss, tev, etc.
* extended Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
* Bayesian statistics tools: credible intervals and contours
* maximum likelihood: profile diagnostic, observed Fisher information matrix
* simple histogram plot (not dependent on any toolbox)
* random variable algebra: sum and product of two independent random variables
* etc.
